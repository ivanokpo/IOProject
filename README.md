BRIEF

Create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, 
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered in training.

KANBAN BOARD

For my Kanban board i used Jira Software and modelled it as an Agile Kanban Board.

Please see the Jira board sent to your respective emails.

DATABASE STRUCTURE

My database had one table, for the object 'Joe' which is the object of my podcasts that the user creates.

FRONT-END

The frontend is powered byHTML, CSSS and Javascript, with the aid of bootstrap framework to design and style the webpage via organised
divs, containers, columns and cards.

BACK-END

The backend is powered by Java using the Spring Boot Framework. Between the database and front-end, this system allows for deployment 
of code quick and in a way that allows for implementation of corrections and improvements

TESTING

As documented in the backend repository, my tests came back with a 87.5% success rate, with only one test not being successful. 
This is something I aim to correct through a revision of code.

STRETCH GOALS

My application has successfully achieved CRUD functionality. However there are a few striking opportunities i would like to work on in the future:

A Favourites tab, highlighting the users favourite podcasts
A watch later tab, where users can save podcasts they wish to view at some point
A Top Guests tab, where users can see who there most watched guests are and find related work from these individuals
A Top Categories tab, so users can find out what their favourite topics and interests are
